# RentAssure

### Vision
The lack of access to financing for vehicle maintenance by public transportation drivers in Latin America

### Description
Users can rent homes through the platform and deposit funds that will be used not only to secure the rental but also as a community fund to finance vehicle repairs for local affiliated mechanics. This combination of services provides a comprehensive solution for users' housing and mobility needs while supporting the local mechanic community.

### Objectives:

Provide a convenient and reliable solution for vehicle owners in need of repairs. Support local mechanics by providing them with an additional source of financing for their businesses. Improve accessibility and transparency in the vehicle repair process.

### Specific problems

Vehicle Repair Financing: Many people may face financial difficulties when paying for unexpected vehicle repairs. HomeWheels addresses this issue by providing a source of financing through funds deposited by users for housing rentals. This helps vehicle owners access repair services without worrying about immediate costs.

Support for Local Mechanics: Local mechanics often face competition from chains and large companies. By partnering with HomeWheels, they have the opportunity to access a new source of customers and financing for their businesses. This helps them maintain and grow their operations, contributing to the economic development of the community.

Facilitation of Secure Transactions: The platform ensures a secure payment process using blockchain technology for both housing rentals and vehicle repairs. This helps users conduct transactions safely and reliably, without concerns about potential fraud or scams.

### Benefits:

Increased access to repair services for vehicle owners. Increased revenue for local mechanics. Simplified financing process for vehicle repairs. Promotion of trust between vehicle owners and mechanics. With this project, the aim is to address the needs of both vehicle owners and mechanics, offering a comprehensive solution that benefits both parties and enhances the overall vehicle repair experience.

### Key Features:

Fund Deposit: Before booking a home, users deposit funds into a RentAssure-plataform. These funds will be used to finance vehicle repairs.

Repair Financing: Local affiliated mechanics can apply for financing for vehicle repairs through RentAssure. The necessary funds come from the money deposited by users for home rentals.

Mechanic Selection: Users can choose from a list of local affiliated mechanics, review their profiles and services offered, and select the one that best suits their needs.

Secure Payment Process: A secure payment process is ensured for both home rental and vehicle repair using blokchain tecnology.
